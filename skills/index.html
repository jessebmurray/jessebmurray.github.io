    <h2>Info</h2>

    <p>
        I’m currently a physics major with a math minor in college. When I’m not doing research, classes, or tutoring, I enjoy thinking of random questions to answer with one of my projects. If it’s a good question, then I work hard (nowadays writing a lot of code) to try to answer the question.
    </p>

    <p>
        After graduating high school, I attended Juilliard for a year to study cello. Although I enjoyed music, I realized that my interests were much broader and more academic. I then transferred to Drew University to study physics. Initially I wanted to go into medicine, however I eventually discovered that I loved math, data, and computer science much more. I’m currently learning about statistical and machine learning, which I hope to use in my current research and future projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        My hobbies include biking and running in nature preserves, playing Catan, and reading articles.

<h2>Skills</h2>
<br>


<h3>Math</h3>

<p>
  I use math in my projects to create simulations or make calculations. I extensively use calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra in physics and math courses. I also have taken courses in probability and statistics including Blitzstein's <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home" target="_blank">Statistics 110</a> online course.
</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>
   I use code in my projects and research to make simulations and to analyze data. I'm fluent with Python and many of its libraries including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I have working knowledge of R, C, HTML, and CSS.
</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
  Since the summer of 2019, I’ve been working with <a href="https://users.drew.edu/mkouh/" target="_blank">Minjoon Kouh</a> on studying eye-tracking while solving anagrams, which has become somewhat of a data science project. During the summer, I designed and tested a method to obtain ‘clean’ letter sequence data by altering color contrast, location, and size of stimuli. In the fall, I conducted an IRB approved study involving 29 college students as participants. We’re currently working on cleaning, preparing, and analyzing the data involving 1.8 million rows and 38 columns, with the objective to apply machine learning techniques. I’ll be presenting the results at the University of Scranton Brain and Behavior Conference on March 7th. You can track our progress on my <a href="https://github.com/jessebmurray/eyetracking" target="_blank">github repository</a>
.
</p>

<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>
  In the fall of 2019, I was President of the Math Club at Drew University and completely redesigned the club, which up to that point was only meeting a few times a semester to eat pizza and play chess. I put up posters around the school of interesting math problems, most of them applying math to real-life situations. I started weekly meetings to solve those problems and to provide students the opportunity to lead discussions on their projects/research or an math-related topic they find interesting. I also began a professor talk series in which – three times a semester – a quantitative professor at Drew gives a math-related talk.
</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>
  I've performed many times on the cello, and am proficient at playing piano. I also have perfect pitch and am knowledgeable about music theory. I’ve done some composition work on Garageband and may add some of those works to this website at some point in the future.
