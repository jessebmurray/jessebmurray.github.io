<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
I have completed numerous research projects, many of which are outlined in the <a href="/">Projects section</a> of this website.
My latest work has focused on computational statistics applications to cognitive science, biology, music and other fields.
I also have experience leading research teams and collaborating with professors. 
I am currently leading an eye-tracking research team of three undergraduate college students 
and three local high school students. 
I am also preparing two papers for publication with <a href="https://www.drew.edu/communications-department/2018/02/13/minjoon-kouh/" target="_blank">Dr. Minjoon Kouh</a>.  
My current research interests include statistical machine learning, especially with applications to biology.

	
</p>

<h3>Math</h3>

<p>
I extensively use math in my research projects to create simulations or apply statistical tests. 
I have taken coursework in calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, probability, and statistics. 
I have also taken advanced physics courses, which heavily involve applied math.
In the past year, I have developed a strong interest in statistics and took Blitzstein's <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home" target="_blank">Statistics 110</a> online course.
</p>


<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>
I use code in my projects and research to make simulations and to analyze data. 
I mostly use Python and its libraries including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Sklearn, and Matplotlib. 
I am also fluent in R and have a working knowledge of MATLAB, C, and HTML.
</p>

<h3>Biology and Chemistry</h3>

<p>
I have taken advanced coursework in biochemistry, organic chemistry, and cellular and molecular biology. 
(For both chemistry and biology, I am graduating one class away from a minor.)
I have found this knowledge to be useful in data science and mathematical modeling applications. 
</p>

	      
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>
In the fall of 2019, I was President of the Math Club at Drew University and completely redesigned the club, 
which up to that point was only meeting a few times a semester to eat pizza and play chess. 
I put up posters around the University of interesting math problems, mostly applying math to real-life situations. 
I started weekly meetings to solve those problems and to provide students the opportunity to 
lead discussions on their projects or an interesting math-related topic.
I also began a professor talk series in which - three times a semester - quantitative professors give informal lectures.
Finally, I redesigned the election process to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method" target="_blank">Condorcet method</a> 
of ranked choice voting. 
</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>
I've performed many times on the cello, and am proficient at playing the piano. I also have perfect pitch and am knowledgeable about music theory. Iâ€™ve done some composition work on Garageband and enjoy improvising on the piano.
