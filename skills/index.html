<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
I am working with <a href="https://www.drew.edu/communications-department/2018/02/13/minjoon-kouh/" target="_blank">Minjoon Kouh</a> 
on a project about eye-tracking while solving anagrams. From observational experiments,
we determined that it could potentially be valuable to accurately know 
the sequence of letters people read before reaching a solution. 
Therefore, we designed and ran a highly stimulus-manipulated anagram experiment 
specifically to 
this end. From the experimental data, I have obtained some interesting results.
As an example, statistics on the number of letters people read before coming 
up with a solution as a function of the anagram word length. Recently, I have 
worked on preparing the data for deep learning methods and other prediction
models. We would like to use features of the letter sequence data to 
predict the average performance of that participant and whether the word was solved or
not solved. I have gained many valuable skills from this project, including having 
the opportunity to mentor talented local high school students such as <a href="https://www.pubfacts.com/detail/31251334/Ranking-migration-cue-contributions-to-guiding-individual-fibroblasts-faced-with-a-directional-decis" target="_blank">Adwik Rahematpura</a>.
I’ll be presenting the results of the research at the University of Scranton Brain and 
Behavior Conference on March 7th. You can track our progress on this 
<a href="https://github.com/jessebmurray/eyetracking" target="_blank">github repository</a>.
</p>

<h3>Math</h3>

<p>
  I use math in my projects to create simulations or make calculations. I extensively use calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra in physics and math courses. I also have taken courses in probability and statistics including Blitzstein's <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home" target="_blank">Statistics 110</a> online course.
</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>
   I use code in my projects and research to make simulations and to analyze data. I'm fluent with Python and many of its libraries including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Sklearn, and Matplotlib. I have working knowledge of MATLAB, C, R, and HTML.
</p>

<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>
  In the fall of 2019, I was President of the Math Club at Drew University and completely redesigned the club, which up to that point was only meeting a few times a semester to eat pizza and play chess. I put up posters around the school of interesting math problems, most of them applying math to real-life situations. I started weekly meetings to solve those problems and to provide students the opportunity to lead discussions on their projects/research or a math-related topic they find interesting. I also began a professor talk series in which quantitative professors at Drew give a math-related talk.
</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>
  I've performed many times on the cello, and am proficient at playing piano. I also have perfect pitch and am knowledgeable about music theory. I’ve done some composition work on Garageband enjoy improvising on the piano.
