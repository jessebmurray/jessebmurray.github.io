                Consider the tallest trees in a forest. Are most of them the offspring of the previous generation's tallest trees or the previous generation's shorter/average trees? While tall trees are more likely to have tall offspring, there are far more average and short trees than tall trees. In this project I created a model of reproducing normal population distributions with regression towards the mean in order to precisely answer this question and many others. When applied to intergenerational movement between quintiles, the model obtained an r<sup>^2</sup> of 0.92 and 0.93 with the Brookings Institution measures of intergenerational education and income mobility, respectively. The model better predicted measures of education and income mobility than those measures predicted one another: r<sup>^2</sup> = 0.84. I'm currently working with a professor towards submitting this paper to a journal. Click on the title to view my best project yet.

                I demonstrate a tuning system I created which I jokingly call 'Murrayean' tuning after the well-known Pythagorean tuning. Here's the Murrayean tuning algorithm: Begin with the fraction 2/1. Multiply the denominator by 2 and switch with the numerator to get the inverse of the interval. Add 1 to the numerator and denominator to get the next interval. Etc. One advantage of Murrayean tuning is that the order of intervals corresponds perfectly to the consonance of the intervals. It is also a consistent algorithm with no breaks in the pattern, unlike the Pythagorean algorithm, which has one break in the pattern. Murrayean tuning is also easier to remember and doesn't involve any big calculations. However, Murrayean tuning does not include the tritone and has a larger average absolute error with Twelve-tone equal temperament than Pythagorean tuning has (1.91% versus 0.258%). Perhaps the coolest part of this project is the discovery that one can multiply the denominator by 2 and switch with the numerator to get the twelve-tone inverse.

                I use data on decomposition times, MSW material densities and annual additions, and landfill depths to simulate the growth in the amount of non-decomposed material in US landfills using an exponential decay model of decomposition. Main results: By the year 2100, plastic will be the largest contributor to total US landfill size in terms of mass and the majority contributor in terms of volume and land area. However, thousands of years into the future, glass becomes the majority contributor because of its 1,000,000-year decomposition time. The amount of non-decomposed material is projected to take up about 400 sq km of US land area by 2100, and about 33,000 sq km (roughly the size of Massachusetts) at equilibrium (when rate of decomposition equals rate of addition). The equilibrium land area is shown to be reduced to about half the size of Rhode Island if the US stops landfilling glass in the year 2200.

                I use historical data on three different index funds: The NASDAQ Composite, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to compare the historical returns using annual rebalancing and different rates of leveraging in intervals of 10% from 0% to 100% across 1,144 10-year periods each spaced one week apart. Main results: All indices had higher median returns with increased leveraged but there were diminishing and even decreasing median returns as leverage increased past 50%. For example: at 50% leverage, the S&P 500 had a median 10-year compound interest rate of 12% as compared to 8.3% for unleveraged. Even in the worst 20-year period (out of 624), moderate amounts of leverage (up to 40%) had higher compound interest rates for all three indices.

                  I use the binomial theorem to lend support to the theory that the very high pre-1800 global fertility rate was a response to the very high global child mortality rate. I explore the probabilities that certain numbers of children survive past five years old and show how the desire for parents to have at least two children survive into adulthood could have led to a strategy of having many children, among other factors. Main results: Having 3 children instead of 2 roughly doubled the probability that at least 2 children survive past 5 years old (from 32% to 60%). When having 6 children, parents obtained a 94% chance that at least 2 survive past childhood. Having 7 then 8 children marginally increased the probability to 97% then 99%, respectively.

                I use SAT score and income data to compare the relative competitiveness and economic rewards of different college majors both for bachelor's degree only as well as graduate degree holders. Main results: The English, Language, and Philosophy/religious are each both highly competitive and highly economically unrewarding. Physical science and Biology majors are highly competitive and relatively economically unrewarding, until a graduate degree is obtained. Then those majors become highly economically rewarding. For overall score - in terms of maximizing the economic rewards as well as the ratio of the rewards to the competitiveness - if one only obtains a bachelor's degree the 'best' majors are Engineering and Computer Science.

                I use equations from special relativity to demonstrate all the amazing things that happen if one chooses to time travel in (one of) the only ways we've discovered how: either go very fast or get next to something heavy. 
              These include apparently gaining weight, watching the earth shrink to the width of a pancake, and more. These effects are calculated when you decide your date of departure, date of arrival (in the future), and how fast you want to get there. 
              But caution, once you travel to the future, you can't come back!
              I made this when I was the TA for a special relativity class at the <a href="http://www.drew.edu/governors-school/" target="_blank">New Jersey Governor’s School in the Sciences</a>, a program for talented New Jersey high school students. 
              I hoped to provide an fun explanation of the effects of moving at high speeds and the significant energy requirements that make time travel technically possible but out of reach.
              I hope to come back to this project when I have some free time (maybe on a vacation) and make a javascript application.

    <li> A visualization of weather data through the feels-like scale, seasonal chance of pretty/ugly weather events such as snow
