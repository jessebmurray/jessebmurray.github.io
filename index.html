                Consider the tallest one fifth of trees in a forest. Are more of them the offspring of the previous generation's tallest one fifth or shorter four fifths? While tall trees are more likely to have tall offspring, there are way more average trees than tall trees. The model I created in this project reproduces polygenic distributions to precisely answer this question and many others. When applied to intergenerational movement between quintiles, the model obtained an r<sup>^2</sup> of 0.92 and 0.93 with the Brookings Institution measures of intergenerational education and income mobility, respectively. The model better predicted measures of education and income mobility than those measures predicted one another: r<sup>^2</sup> = 0.84. Click on the title to view my best project yet.

                I use data on landfill depth as well as the decomposition times, densities, and annual additions into landfills for each of the different types of municipal solid waste in order to model the growth of US landfills into the future. The results show how large we can expect landfills to be in the future and indicate the somewhat surprising waste-type culprits that drive the long-term growth of landfills.

                I use historical data on three different index funds: The NASDAQ Composite, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to compare the historical returns using annual rebalancing and different rates of leveraging in intervals of 10% from 0% to 100% across 1,144 10-year periods each spaced one week apart. This is a good example of a project that could've been done much better using code, but because I hadn't yet learned to code I made excel sheets thousands of rows deep and about one hundred columns wide.

                  I use the binomial theorem to lend support to the theory that the very high pre-1800 global fertility rate was a response to the very high global child mortality rate. I explore the probabilities that certain numbers of children survive past five years old and show how the desire for parents to have at least two children survive into adulthood could have led to a strategy of having many children, among other factors.

                I use SAT score and income data to compare the relative competitiveness and economic rewards of different college majors both for bachelor's degree only as well as graduate degree holders. I conclude with a scoring of the 'best' college majors if one only obtains a bachelor's degree and some thoughts about why not everyone chooses those majors.

                I use equations from special relativity to demonstrate all the amazing things that happen if one chooses to time travel in (one of) the only ways we've discovered how: either go very fast or get next to something heavy. These include apparently gaining weight, watching the earth shrink to the width of a pancake, and more. These effects are calculated when you decide your date of departure, date of arrival (in the future), and how fast you want to get there. But caution, once you travel to the future, you can't come back!

I use this data to compare the different foods in a vareity of ways including energy density, cost, and overall healthiness score.

        I have a few other projects I’m working on or hoping to start soon. They are on topics including weather data, speeding tickets, and efficiently walking through a city grid.

    <br>
        Most of the older projects could've been done much faster, accurately, or more made more generalizable if I had known python earlier. Once I learned coding I realized that for so long I had essentially been trying to code with excel, which is naturally very inefficient.
