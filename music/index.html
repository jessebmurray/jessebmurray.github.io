	  The improvisations or little GarageBand projects are listed in order of most to least cool (in my opinion). They are all very rough/incomplete. I’ll be adding new music here over time.

<h3>Message to the Listener</h3>

<p>
   Please listen with a grain of salt, as they say. I spend only a small amount of time nowadays on music and this is a part of the website that I was convinced by some friends to add, and is really just for fun. It includes some improvisations on piano (cello coming soon) and little projects on GarageBand. I’d like to emphasize that the improvisations are truly improvisations, which means that there’s occasional mistakes, sometimes the idea isn’t fully formed until 50% of the way through, and often you can literally hear pauses as I come up with the next chord. Also I was trained on the cello and only picked up piano as a side instrument during high school and at Juilliard. The GarageBand projects also aren’t fully developed. But, if you enjoy then awesome!

<h3>GarageBand, Perplexed Tune</h3>

<h3>Piano Improv, Hopeful</h3>

  <p>
    This one is a rough improvisation that I believe starts to get good around the middle. So if you do listen to it, I only ask that you listen to the full thing. But it makes decent background music.

	  Oddly enough, the three GarageBand projects shown here were all made on the same day.
