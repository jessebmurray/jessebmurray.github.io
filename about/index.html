  I am a graduate student at the University of Oxford pursuing computational biology research. My current degree of study is an MSc in Statistical Science, which is a twelve-month Master's degree that teaches modern computationally-intensive approaches and includes a research dissertation. I am also working on the research from my summer internship at NASA Ames Research Center, for which I am <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/710772">developing machine learning models</a> to reveal biosignatures relevant to life-detection missions.

    After high school, I spent a year at Juilliard studying the cello.
    However, my interests became too broad and academic for a career in music.
  	I then transferred late in the summer to Drew University where I studied as a physics major and mathematics minor. Initially aiming for a medical career, I gradually discovered my passion for mathematical modeling and gaining insights from large, complex datasets.

    My undergraduate research was on trying to understand the mostly unconscious cognitive process that occurs when solving an <a href="https://www.gamesforthebrain.com/game/anagramania/">anagram puzzle</a>. To do this, I designed and oversaw an original eye-tracking experiment. From the messy coordinate-time-series data (90 million rows), I was able to obtain new results that I later <a class="post-link" href="../project_files/eyetracking_poster.pdf">presented</a> at a neuroscience conference. I have also enjoyed completing numerous small research projects in my spare time that apply simulation, statistical analysis, and modeling to real-world situations.

        A huge motivation for me has been <a href="https://www.lsmurray.com/">my inspiring brother</a>. My hobbies include visiting nature preserves and making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MurrayScience">occasional</a> contributions to Wikipedia.
