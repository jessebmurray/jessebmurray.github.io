    <h2>Info</h2>

    <p>
        I’m currently a physics major with a math minor in college. When I’m not doing research, classes, or tutoring, I enjoy thinking of random questions to answer with one of my projects. If it’s a good question, then I work hard (usually writing a lot of code) to try to answer the question.
    </p>

    <p>
        After graduating high school, I attended Juilliard for a year to study cello. Although I enjoyed music, I realized that my interests were much broader and more academic. I then transferred to Drew University to study physics. Initially I wanted to go into medicine, however I eventually discovered that I loved math, data, and computer science much more. I’m currently learning about statistical and machine learning, which I hope to use in future projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        My hobbies include biking and running in nature preserves, playing Catan, and reading articles.

<h2>Skills</h2>
<br>

<h3>Coding</h3>

<p>
   I use code in my projects and research to make simulations and to analyze data. I'm fluent with Python and many of its libraries including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I have working knowledge of R, C, HTML, and CSS. I have basic knowledge of Java and C++.
</p>

<h3>Math</h3>

<p>
  I use math in my projects to create simulations, which often involve mathematical structures. I extensively use calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra in physics and math courses. I also have taken courses in probability and statistics including Blitzstein's <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home" target="_blank">Statistics 110</a> online course.
</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
  Since the summer of 2019, I’ve been working with <a href="https://users.drew.edu/mkouh/" target="_blank">Minjoon Kouh</a> on eye-tracking research, which has become somewhat of a data science project.
