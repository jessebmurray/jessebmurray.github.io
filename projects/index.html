                I use data on decomposition rates, landfill depth and density, and annual additions of the different types of waste into landfills to model the growth of landfills into the future. The results show how large we can expect landfills to be in the future and indicate the somewhat surprising waste-type culprits that drive the long-term growth of landfills.

                I use concepts such as regression towards the mean, the breeder's equation, and the normal distribution of polygenic traits to simulate what happens to the distribution of a polygenic trait when a 'parent' generation reproduces to create the next 'offspring' generation. The original motivation for this project was to answer the question: Consider the tallest one fifth of trees in a forest. Are more of them the offspring of the previous generation's tallest one fifth or shorter four fifths? While tall trees are more likely to have tall offspring, there are way more average trees than tall trees. This project simulates reproducing polygenic distributions to precisely answer this question and many others.

                I use equations from special relativity to demonstrate all the amazing things that happen if one chooses to time travel in the only ways we've discovered how: either go very fast or get next to something heavy. These include apparently gaining weight, watching the earth shrink to the width of a pancake, being able to see radio waves, and more. These effects are calculated for you exactly in the interactive code when you decide your date of departure, date of arrival (in the future), and how fast you want to get there. But caution, once you travel to the future, you can't come back!

                I use historical data on three different index funds: The NASDAQ Composite, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to demonstrate historical returns with annual rebalancing and various rates of leveraging.

              Skateboarding is hard. I might not be able to skate to save my life, but I can do a little physics. So here’s a thought - maybe I can use physics to learn how to do an ollie.

              I want to tell you about one of the most beautiful ideas that I know. It’s a physics experiment, and it’s beautiful because in one elegant stroke, it expands our consciousness, forcing us to realize that objects can behave in ways that are impossible for us to picture (but remarkably, possible for us to calculate). It’s beautiful because it calls into question the bedrock of logic on which we’ve built our understanding of the world. It’s beautiful because it’s deceivingly simple to understand, and yet its consequences are deeply unsettling. And it’s beautiful because I refused to accept it until I ran the experiment for myself, and I distinctly remember watching my worldview shatter as the picture slowly built up on the computer monitor.

        I have a few other projects I’m currently working on, which will be posted here at some point in the next few months. They are on topics including weather data, nutrition data, birth rates, speeding tickets, and efficiently walking through a city grid.

        Although I haven't yet collaborated with someone else on a project, I'm more than happy to do so. If you'd like to collaborate with me on a project, please shoot me an email!
